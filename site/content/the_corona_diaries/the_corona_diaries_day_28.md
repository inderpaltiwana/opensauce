## There was an idea

So here it is.

Trading and Tech is what I love. I'm slightly better at one than the other. So what can i do to mix them together, this has always been an issue and i've never quite known the answer to this.

So maybe this can finally be take one?

In finance charts are king, sentiment is queen, and in crypto charts are queen twitter sentiment is king. All jokes aside there is a heavy reliance on both charting, which has ushered in a wave of supreme charters and created market movers from this. This is big in trading in general, even bigger in crypto if you can shepard the masses.

So the true king in both of these is data. I want to combine this with tech. More specifically build an application on tech that I am familiar with.

So this is it. A technical analysis hub based in grafana/promethus using a few apis to consume data some of which have been mentioned in previous posts and other have not such as coinmarketcap, really useful for long term data. that will require grafana to be installed somewhere.

Linked to this, a python bot which can execute trading stratergies based on simple TA. so how can i bring these two things together. Kubernetes more specifically OpenShift/OKD. I will build a project which has 2 points of interest, a long term data platform, currently based in grafana/promethus with an executor to kick off python scripts which go away and lose me money.

## Tasks for the week?

1.  Set up a cluster, get one running in a cloud based instance. (4.x)
2.  Deploy a monitoring stack
3. Start consuming CoinMarketCap

## Whats going on this week?

Day 28 of lockdown
