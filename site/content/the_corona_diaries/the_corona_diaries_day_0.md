  With all this free time how can I make the most of it?
---
## How can i make myself useful?

Blogs?

Trading?

Twitter?

All great content but how can I utilise them for my own gratification?

TBC...maybe just maybe alpha vantange running in a container, with a bit of python logic to spit out some real time trading data, hmmm, sounds like a plan for tomorrow. But today I think we've got an idea to run with.

Oh and did I mention it would be running on kubernetes. oooooooooooh

## Tasks for the week?

Spin up a Kubernetes flavour of choice, most probably OKD/OpenShift. But as I said that is a task for tomorrow.

## Whats going on this week?

EU markets have a multi day rally & Crypto looking to hit a top, halvening and other events going on.
Twitter continues to drain me, Gymming it at home? currently on hold.
